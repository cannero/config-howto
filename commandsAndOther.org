*** InnoDB
- create index allows concurrent DML, see http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/innodb-create-index-overview.html
- MySQL will not use indexes if you query the wrong data type
- show open transactions show (engine old without) innodb status: block with transactions
*** mysqldump
- export schema:

** WinDbg

- http://blogs.msdn.com/b/johan/archive/2007/01/11/how-to-install-windbg-and-get-your-first-memory-dump.aspx
*** General
  - all commands starting with . are from windbg
  - commands starting with ! are from some loaded extension
*** Installation
  - included in Debugging Tools for Windows
*** Setup
  - copy sos.dll from C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\ (or Framework64) to windbg folder for .Net debugging
  - load it with .load sos
  - Create a folder where you want to cache all the symbol files. For example: "C:\Symbols"
  - Start windbg and open the dialogue to configure the symbol path by clicking File -> Symbol File Path
    srv*c:\symbols\public*http://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols
  - reload the dlls with .reload
  - if mscordacwks.dll cannot be loaded:
    this should show the load path:
    !sym noisy
    .symfix c:\mylocalsymcache
    .cordll -ve -u -l
    just copy the dll from the target pc to windbg folder and rename it to mscordacwks_AAA_AAA_2.0.50727.xxxx.dll,
    AAA is either x86 or AMD64, xxxx are the last digits of the version number
    lmv m mscorwks shows the include path for the dll

*** emacs keybinding > 2008
for 2019:
https://github.com/justcla/EmacsKeys
--> source code has to be edited also for the newest visual studio extension
    Download the Emacs emulation extension.

    Rename it from EmacsEmulations.vsix to EmacsEmulations.zip and unzip into a folder.

    Edit the <VisualStudio Version="10.0"> value on the extensions.vsixmanifest file (XML):

    <SupportedProducts>
        <VisualStudio Version="11.0">
        <Edition>Pro</Edition>
        </VisualStudio>
    </SupportedProducts>

    Note: Visual Studio 2013 works by setting Version="12.0". And VS Express can be used by setting <Edition>Express_All</Edition>
          Visual Studio 2015 "14.0"
    Zip the content inside the folder back up and rename it back to EmacsEmulations.vsix.
    Install the extension as the user who needs the bindings and not as administrator.
    Manually copy the Emacs.vsk file from the unzipped content of the extension to the Common7\IDE folder in the Visual Studio program directory (for which you will need elevated permissions).

** disable telemetry data gathering

** Wireshark
- Wireshark can't actually capture local packets on windows XP due to the nature of the windows TCP stack. When packets are sent and received on the same machine they don't seem to cross the network boundary that wireshark monitors.

    However there is a way around this, you can route the local traffic out via your network gateway (router) by setting up a (temporary) static route on your windows XP machine.

    Say your XP IP address is 192.168.0.2 and your gateway (router) address is 192.168.0.1 you could run the following command from windows XP command line to force all local traffic out and back across the network boundary, so wireshark could then track the data (note that wireshark will report packets twice in this scenario, once when they leave your pc and once when they return).

    route add 192.168.0.2 mask 255.255.255.255 192.168.0.1 metric 1

  ! First save the route for the ip address and add it afterwards again!
  add -p to make the change persistent

- filter for ip address and destination
  ip.addr == 142.120.20.133 & ip.dst == 142.120.60.20

   http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12520456/execjsruntimeerror-on-windows-trying-to-follow-rubytutorial

My friend was attempting a Rails tutorial on Win 8 RTM a few months ago and ran into this error. Not sure if this issue exists in Windows 7 as well, but this may help.

Options:

1) Removing //= require_tree . / Ignoring the issue - As ColinR stated above, this line should not be causing an issue in the first place. There is an actual problem with ExecJS working properly with the JavaScript runtime on your system and removing this line is just ignoring that fact.

2) Installing Node.js / Running away - Many people seem to just end up installing Node.js and using that instead of the JavaScript runtime already on their system. While that is a valid option, it also requires additional software and only avoids the original issue, which is that ExecJS is not working properly with the JavaScript runtime already on your system. If the existing JavaScript runtime on your system is supposed to work, why not make it work instead of installing more software? According to the ExecJS creator, the runtime already built into Windows is in fact supported...

    ExecJS lets you run JavaScript code from Ruby. It automatically picks the best runtime available to evaluate your JavaScript program, then returns the result to you as a Ruby object.

    ExecJS supports these runtimes:

        therubyracer - Google V8 embedded within Ruby
        therubyrhino - Mozilla Rhino embedded within JRuby
        Node.js
        Apple JavaScriptCore - Included with Mac OS X
        Microsoft Windows Script Host (JScript)

    (from github.com/sstephenson/execjs#execjs )

3) Actually fixing the issue / Learning - Use the knowledge of options 1 and 2 to search for other solutions. I can't tell you how many webpages I closed upon seeing options 1 or 2 was the accepted solution before actually finding information about the root issue we were having. The only reason we kept looking was that we couldn't believe the Rails team would (1) insert a line of code in every scaffold generated project that caused an issue, or (2) require that we install additional software just to run that default line of code. And so we eventually arrived at a fix for our root issue (your miles may vary).

The Fix that worked for us: On the system having issues, find ExecJS's runtimes.rb file. It looks like this. Make a copy of the found file for backup. Open the original runtimes.rb for editing. Find the section that starts with the line JScript = ExternalRuntime.new(. In that section, on the line containing :command => "cscript //E:jscript //Nologo //U", - remove the //U only. Then on the line containing :encoding => 'UTF-16LE' # CScript with //U returns UTF-16LE - change UTF-16LE to UTF-8 . Save the changes to the file. This section of the file should now read:

JScript = ExternalRuntime.new(
    :name        => "JScript",
    :command     => "cscript //E:jscript //Nologo",
    :runner_path => ExecJS.root + "/support/jscript_runner.js",
    :encoding    => 'UTF-8' # CScript with //U returns UTF-16LE
)

Next, stop then restart your Rails server and refresh the page in your browser that produced the original error. Hopefully the page loads without error now. Here's the ExecJS issue thread where we originally posted our results: https://github.com/sstephenson/execjs/issues/81#issuecomment-9892952

If this did not fix the issue, you can always overwrite the modified runtimes.rb with the backup copy you (hopefully) made and everything will be back to square one. In that case, consider option 3 and keep searching. Let us know what eventually works for you.. unless it's removing the require_tree or installing node.js, there's plenty of that going around already. :)

**** problem with bluecloth 2.2.0


     Run gem install bluecloth -v '2.2.0' if you haven't already

     Apply this patch on bluecloth.h file, on my machine it is located in

     H:\Ruby193\lib\ruby\gems\1.9.1\gems\bluecloth-2.2.0\ext\bluecloth.h

     Go to bluecloth 2.2.0 directory, for example

     H:\Ruby193\lib\ruby\gems\1.9.1\gems\bluecloth-2.2.0

     Run rake gem (this may require to install some additional gems).

     Then you should see .gem file created in

     H:\Ruby193\lib\ruby\gems\1.9.1\gems\bluecloth-2.2.0\pkg\bluecloth-2.2.0.gem

     Open this directory and install the patched gem:

     gem install bluecloth-2.2.0.gem --platform=ruby

     => will not work, but gem install works after that

** disable beep: To turn it off for only one session, do the following:

   1. Click Start
   2. Click Run
   3. In the run box type
      net stop beep

To turn off the beep permanently, do the following:

1. Click Start
   2. Click Run
   3. In the run box type
      sc config beep start= disabled (please note the space after the = !!)

To change the status of the beep again, type any of the following in the run box:

    * sc config beep start= boot (for loading device driver by the boot loader)
    * sc config beep start= system (for loading device driver by the kernel initialization)
    * sc config beep start= auto (for starting service automatically at startup. Even when no one logs on)
    * sc config beep start= demand (for starting service manually (default, when no start parameter is specified))
    * sc config beep start= disabled (completely disables the service)
    * sc config beep start= delayed-auto (for starting service after other “auto” services are started)

** To disable ThinPrint on a View client, change the values of these registry keys as indicated:

    HKEY_CURRENT_USER Software VMware, Inc. VMware VDM Client RDP Settings RedirectPrinters = false
    HKLM SOFTWARE thinPrint TPAutoConnect ConnectToClient = DISABLED 

Notes:

    If the keys do not exist, create them with values of type STRING.
    You may have to reboot the client for the changes to take effect.
    This method disables ThinPrint on the client side only. The View Desktop can use ThinPrint to print when you connect to it from a different client computer. 

Additional Information
You may also disable ThinPrint within the virtual desktop by disabling the TP AutoConnect Service and TP VC Gateway Service.

To disable ThinPrint within the virtual desktop:

    Log in to the virtual machine.
    Open the Services console.
    Right-click the TP AutoConnect service.
    Click Properties.
    Under Service status, click Stop.
    Click the Startup type and click Disabled.
    Click OK.
    Repeat steps 1-7 for the TP VC Gateway service.
    Close the Services console. 
** Host USB device connection disabled

** Windows
   Here's a Windows tip that I find invaluable for tools such as editors. Rather than associating Emacs with the particular file types you want to edit with it (because you may want to associate another application with them), add Emacs to your SendTo menu.

   - Open the folder where you installed Emacs and navigate to the bin directory.
   - Select runemacs.exe, click mouse-button-2 and select Create Shortcut. The new shortcut appears, highlighted.
   - Click mouse-button-2 again and select Cut (you're going to move it).
   - Move to the Start button and click mouse-button-2 to open the menu.
   - Select Explore, which should open Windows Explorer to the Start Menu folder.
    In the navigation pane, select the SendTo folder (usually just above the Start Menu folder) to open it.
    Within the SendTo folder, click mouse-button-2 and select Paste to insert the runemacs.exe shortcut.
    Rename the shortcut, if you like.

** misc commands
*** file layout
    show regex in new buffer

*** set encoding
    C-x C-m f
*** remove complete line
    flush-line (opposite of keep-line)

*** replace in files
    M-x find-name-dired: you will be prompted for a root directory and a filename pattern.
    Press t to "toggle mark" for all files found.
    Press Q for "Query-Replace in Files...": you will be prompted for query/substitution regexps.
    To turn off the automatic switch of the letter case set case-replace to nil.
*** execute shell command
(shell-command-to-string "hostname")
*** get char info
    describe-char for character at point

*** pretty print xml
in sgml mode select region and run sgml-pretty-print
*** insert text at beginning of line

* git
** basics
   - .gitignore for files which should not be shown in untracked files
   - add project to github
     create project on github
     git remote add origin https://github.com/cannero/monkey_interpreter_compiler.git
     git push -u origin master
   - on windows set credential.helper=manager if login to azure devops not possible
** commands
   - add: add files, redo if changed, -A adds all files, -u only modified and deleted files
   - commit: commit -m 'message', -a for all unstaged changes
   - diff
     --cached shows diff with staged files
     <commit> <commit> for difference between two commits
     compare to last version: @{1} <file>, short for HEAD@{1}
     compare to master: git diff origin/master -- [local-path]
     all changes between two commits, path can be also files: git diff commit1^..commit2 -- [<path>...]
   - log
     show last i commits with -n i
     short overview with files: --stat
     patch output of last two commits: -p -2
     log graph: --graph --decorate --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit
     Only show commits adding or removing code matching the string: -S string
   - add to last commit
     git commit --amend --no-edit
     no-edit flag re-uses the last commit message
   - rename case insensitive folders
     git mv foldername tempname && git mv tempname folderName
   - create mbox file from commits, first commit not included
     git format-patch --stdout 7c46acb1..c8ee6573 > 01.3_15.3.patch
     for last commit git format-patch --stdout HEAD^
   - undo add
     git reset, git reset <file>
     if no head exists git rm --cached <added_file_to_undo>
   - To get an inclusive list of commits, just list the two references separated by a space. Your first reference should reference the previous commit with a tilda ~ and then be excluded which is denoted with a leading circumflex ^
     git rev-list --reverse ^<tag1>~ <tag2>
   - To list all files in a commit
     git diff-tree --no-commit-id --name-only -r bd61ad98
     --name-status instead for action
   - To revert single file before commit
     git checkout c5f567~1 -- file1/to/restore file2/to/restore
   - branch
     to show remote ones -r
     rename local branch: -m <oldname> <newname>, case sensitive -M
     rename local and remote:
     git branch -m <old_name> <new_name>
     git push <remote> --delete <old_name>
     # Or shorter way to delete remote branch [:]
     git push <remote> :<old_name>
     git push <remote> <new_name>
     git push <remote> -u <new_name>
   - cherry-pick
   - remove changes in all tracked files
     git checkout -f
   - remove untracked files git clean -f, test run git clean -nf, . for current directory
   - reset
     git reset --hard <HEAD/sha> or origin/branch
   - merge
     --no-ff to create a new commit without fast forward
   - stash
     add new entry with push -m
     list with stash list, stash show @{index}
     restore with stash apply --index n
   - status
     to not show untracked files: -uno
   - rev-parse, parents of commits
     first parent ref~, ref^
     second parent ref^2
     parent of parent ref~
     two commits back master~2
   - config
     show all entries: git config --list
     don't change line ending: git config --global core.autocrlf input
   - show/change remote origin/master or upstream
     show: git remote -v
     change: git remote set-url origin new.git.url/here
   - add second remote (upstream) for getting changes for fork
     git remote add upstream https://github.com/whoever/whatever.git
     git fetch upstream
     git checkout master
     git rebase upstream/master
     git push -f origin master
   - push
     after rebase push with --force-with-lease to check if remote has been updated in between

* OOP
** Basics and Principles
- Encapsulate what varies
- Favor composition over inheritance: has-a is better than is-a; changeable during runtime
- Program to an interface not an implementation: model behavior in new abstract class, reusable and modifyable
- Strive for loosely coupled designs: objects can interact, but have very little knowledge of each other
- Open Closed Principle: Classes should be closed for modification but open for extension
- Dependency Inversion Principle: Depend upon abstraction and not upon concrete classes
- Principle of least knowledge (Only talk to your immediate friends): only invoke methods that belong to the object itself, to objects passed in as parameter, to any objects the method creates or instantiates (no methods on objects that were returned from calling other methods) and to any components of the object (has-a)
- Hollywood Principle: Don't call us, we call you
- Single Responsibility: a class should have only one reason to change
** Patterns
structural, behavioral, creational, concurrency patterns
- Strategy
  b
  defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable; algorithm can be modified independently from clients

- Observer
  b
  defines a one-to-many dependency between objects; all dependents are notified and udated automatically (push or pull by dependent)

- Decorator
  s
  a decorator attaches additional responsibilities to an object (the component) dynamically; the component can be used on its own or wrapped by a decorator; the decorator has-a component and implements the same interface as the component and adds new behavoirs

- Factory
  c
  a factory method handles object creation and encapsulates it in a subclass; the subclass decides which object to create; the method is only a interface in the base class, which can create a family of related or dependent products (abstract factory) or a single one

- Singleton
  c
  only one object is instanciated and a global point of access is provided

- Command
  b
  this pattern encapsulates a request as an object, thereby letting you parametrize other objects with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations

- Adapter/Wrapper/Translator
  s
  converts the interface of a class into another one the clients expect

- Facade
  s
  provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use

- Template Method
  b
  defines the steps of an algorithm (skeleton) and allows subclasses to provide the implementation for one or more steps

- Iterator
  b
  an iterator provides a way to access elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation

- Composite
  s
  compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierachies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and composition of objects uniformly

- State
  b
  allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class

- Proxy
  s
  provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it

- Bridge
  s
  decouples an implementation from the interface, abstraction and implementation can be extended independently

- Builder
  c
  encapsulate the way a complex object is constructed and allows objects to be constructed in multistep

- Chain of Responsibility
  b
  decouples the sender and receiver of the request

- Flyweight
  s
  one instance of a class can be used to provide many virtual instances

- Mediator
  b
  centralize complex communications and control between related objects

- Memento
  b
  return an object to one of its previous states by keeping the saved state external from the key object

- Prototype
  c
  hide the complexities of making new instances of a given class from the client

- Visitor
  b
  add capabilities to a composite of objects if encapsulation is not important


* Android
** gradle
*** version does not match for project
in the gradle/wrapper folder set the version in gradle-wrapper.properties,
then run gradlew.bat.
Gradle has to be synchronized after that in Android Studio
** debugging
*** adb shell
- access emulator
in the sdk folder, platform tools start 'adb shell'
- send location
adb.exe emu geo fix 100 200
- remove database
adb -e shell rm /data/data/com.example.package/databases/*.db
- remove app
adb -e uninstall com.example.package
*** evaluate command
in the Debug window key evaluate expression
*** logcat
- disable eglCodecCommon
eglCodecCommon: glUtilsParamSize: unknow param
happens due to emulator using host GPU
define filter with tag ^(?!eglCodecCommon)
** change visual style
   get zip from http://android-holo-colors.com/ with the style and copy it in res folder
   combine styles.xml and themes_apptheme.xml, only one style with name="AppTheme"
   parent should be compatible with sdk version
** avd
if the sdcard is just a link to somewhere: Tools -> Android ->
avd Manager set sdcard to enabled and maybe change disk size

* Javascript
** JsTestDriver
   startup: java -jar JsTestDriver-1.3.5.jar --port 42442

* theory
** game theory
“The theory of games is a theory of decision-making.” This involves both how you feel you should make decisions, and how you actually make decisions, which is why understanding your motivations is valuable, because as Davis says, “your decisions are linked to your goals.”
*** goal focused
    See goals as a path to success
    Focus on the rewards you’ll gain when you achieve the outcome
    Be willing to take risks
    Feel comfortable jumping into opportunities, and work quickly
    Pay less attention to risks to your detriment, and be less prepared when things derail
*** prevention focused
See goals as important responsibilities to manage
Take care to outline potential risks
Strategize on process and progress to protect against risk
Stay vigilant about what you gain, and focus on keeping those gains
Be a problem-solver, and spend time on thorough analysis
Take a little extra time to get on the right path the first time
